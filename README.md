# Flight Network Management
This project within the AED Curricular Unit aims to implement various algorithms to determine the "best path" in a worldwide flight network. To achieve this, a dataset with real-world data about flight distances and the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of airports was used.

#### Grade: 20/20
